# Notes:
# - All dates should be quoted to prevent YAML from interpreting them as mathematical expressions
# - UUIDs should be valid UUID v4 format
# - For new spans that don't exist in the database, omit the 'id' field
# - For new connections, omit the 'connection_id' field
# - Nested connections allow complex relationships like "Person has Role at Organisation"
# - Metadata fields are optional and can contain any additional information
# - Connection types can be extended based on your specific needs
# - Span types: person, organisation, place, event, thing, band, role
# - Connection types: employment, residence, attendance, ownership, membership, family, relationship, travel, participation, education, has_role
# - Family connections are special: 'parents' and 'children' map to the 'family' connection type
