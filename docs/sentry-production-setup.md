# Sentry Production Error Monitoring Setup

## Overview

Sentry is a powerful error monitoring and performance tracking platform that provides real-time insights into application errors and performance issues. This document outlines how to configure Sentry for the Lifespan application.

## Why Sentry Over Flare?

### Advantages for Lifespan
- **Better Free Tier**: 5,000 errors/month (vs Flare's 2,000)
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in transaction monitoring perfect for timeline API
- **More Established**: Larger community and better documentation
- **Cost-Effective**: Better value as you scale
- **Production-Ready**: More mature platform with better reliability

### Perfect for Your Use Case
- Complex timeline performance optimizations
- Database-heavy operations with temporal constraints
- AI YAML generation features
- User authentication and authorization
- Import/export functionality

## Current Setup Status

âœ… **Sentry is installed and configured**
- Package: `sentry/sentry-laravel`
- Configuration: `config/sentry.php`
- Environment variables: Added to `.env`
- Test events: Successfully sent

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Your `.env` file now includes:

```env
SENTRY_LARAVEL_DSN=https://62d59ca36c3741769d1622c8578f4d89@o133107.ingest.us.sentry.io/294067
SENTRY_SEND_DEFAULT_PII=true
SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE=1.0
```

### Configuration Options

- **SENTRY_LARAVEL_DSN**: Your Sentry project's DSN (Data Source Name)
- **SENTRY_SEND_DEFAULT_PII**: Send user data (IP, user agent, etc.)
- **SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE**: Performance monitoring sample rate (1.0 = 100%)

## Features Enabled

### 1. Error Monitoring
- Automatic exception capture
- Stack traces with context
- User information and session data
- Request details and headers

### 2. Performance Monitoring
- Transaction tracking
- Database query monitoring
- Slow query detection
- Timeline API performance insights

### 3. User Context
- User ID and email (when authenticated)
- Session information
- Request metadata

## Integration with Existing Code

### RequestResponseLogger Middleware

Your existing `RequestResponseLogger` middleware already has Sentry integration:

```php
// For 500 errors, include Sentry event ID
if ($status >= 500 && app()->bound('sentry')) {
    $data['sentry_id'] = app('sentry')->getLastEventId();
}
```

This provides correlation between your application logs and Sentry events.

## Performance Monitoring for Timeline API

### Custom Performance Tracking

Add performance monitoring to your timeline endpoints:

```php
// In your timeline controllers
use Sentry\SentrySdk;

public function timeline(Span $span)
{
    $transaction = SentrySdk::getCurrentHub()->startTransaction(
        new TransactionContext('timeline.load', 'timeline')
    );
    
    try {
        // Your timeline logic here
        $connections = $this->getTimelineConnections($span);
        
        $transaction->setData('span_id', $span->id);
        $transaction->setData('connections_count', count($connections));
        
        return response()->json($connections);
    } finally {
        $transaction->finish();
    }
}
```

### Database Query Monitoring

Sentry automatically captures slow database queries. You can also add custom spans:

```php
use Sentry\SentrySdk;

$span = SentrySdk::getCurrentHub()->startSpan(
    new SpanContext('db.query', 'database')
);

try {
    $results = DB::table('connections')->where('parent_id', $spanId)->get();
    $span->setData('query_type', 'connections_by_span');
    $span->setData('results_count', count($results));
} finally {
    $span->finish();
}
```

## Security and Privacy

### Data Protection
- **PII Handling**: `SENTRY_SEND_DEFAULT_PII=true` sends user data
- **IP Addresses**: Automatically captured (can be anonymized)
- **Sensitive Data**: Avoid logging passwords, API keys, or personal information

### Environment Separation
- Use different Sentry projects for staging and production
- Configure different DSNs per environment
- Set appropriate sample rates per environment

## Monitoring Strategy

### Critical Areas to Monitor

1. **Timeline API Endpoints**
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Database query issues
   - Cache problems
   - Memory usage

2. **Import/Export Operations**
   - File processing errors
   - Memory issues
   - Validation failures
   - Processing time

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Login failures
   - Permission errors
   - Session issues
   - Rate limiting

4. **AI YAML Generation**
   - OpenAI API errors
   - Processing failures
   - Memory consumption
   - Response times

### Alert Configuration

Set up alerts in Sentry for:
- **High Error Rates**: >5% error rate
- **Performance Issues**: Response times >2 seconds
- **Critical Errors**: 500 status codes
- **Database Issues**: Connection failures
- **Memory Issues**: High memory usage

## Cost Considerations

### Free Tier (Hobby Plan)
- **5,000 errors/month**
- **30-day retention**
- **Performance monitoring**
- **Basic features**

### Paid Plans
- **Team**: $26/month for 50,000 errors
- **Business**: $80/month for 100,000 errors
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing

### Cost Optimization
- Filter out non-critical errors
- Use error grouping effectively
- Monitor usage to stay within limits
- Adjust sample rates based on traffic

## Best Practices

### Error Reporting
1. **Don't Over-Report**: Focus on actionable errors
2. **Add Context**: Include relevant application state
3. **Group Similar Errors**: Avoid noise from repeated issues
4. **Monitor Performance**: Track error reporting overhead

### Performance Monitoring
1. **Key Transactions**: Monitor critical user journeys
2. **Database Queries**: Track slow queries and N+1 problems
3. **External APIs**: Monitor OpenAI and other external services
4. **Memory Usage**: Track memory consumption patterns

### Maintenance
1. **Regular Review**: Check error reports weekly
2. **Clean Up**: Remove resolved issues
3. **Update Context**: Keep custom context relevant
4. **Monitor Costs**: Track usage and optimize

## Integration with Existing Tools

### With Telescope
- **Telescope**: Local development debugging
- **Sentry**: Production error monitoring
- **Complementary**: Both serve different purposes

### With Debugbar
- **Debugbar**: Real-time local debugging
- **Sentry**: Production monitoring and alerting
- **No Conflict**: Different environments

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **DSN Issues**: Verify DSN is correct and active
- **No Reports**: Check network connectivity and firewall
- **Performance Impact**: Monitor error reporting overhead
- **Data Privacy**: Review what data is being sent

### Testing
- Test events are automatically sent during setup
- Use Sentry's test event feature to verify configuration
- Monitor the Sentry dashboard for incoming events
